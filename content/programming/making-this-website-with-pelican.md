Summary: Path through making this website.

For the first article in the blog I'd like to explain the whole process that I made to set this website in
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) a static site generator powered
by [Python](https://www.python.org/).

#### Why Pelican and why GitHub Pages?
Because this website doesn't need a backend to fulfill its purpose, and because I don't want to mess around with a
server service (for now), I decided to host it in GitHub Pages, a free service that uses your GitHub repository directly to
generate a website.
Now, there are a large amount of ways to make a blog like this one, and there are others blogging
framewroks out there to use with GitHub Pages like [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), 
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (although Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages),
and pretty much anything that can produce HTML and CSS, even your bare hands with a Text Editor.

All of this frameworks have something different, but they make the same work in the end.
So I chose Pelican simply because it's written in Python, and I love Python. :smile:

With that being said let's get started.
